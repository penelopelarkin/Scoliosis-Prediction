# Observational Scoliosis Diagnosis with Deep Learning
### By Penelope Larkin

## Abstract
This research notebook explores the possibility of diagnosing scoliosis with high accuracy from a single photo of a person's back taken with a consumer-grade camera, like a simple smartphone, instead of using an X-ray. The model is 76% successful on the validation set and the class activation maps confirms the model is learning medically relavent features. This model could be used in communities or countries where access to X-rays is limited or where medical staff has not been trained to detect scoliosis. Additionally, reducing the number of X-rays needed to assess and monitor patientsâ€™ conditions would lower costs and limit exposure to radiation.

This notebook is a self-directed research project. Thank you to InspiritAI for teaching me the fundamentals and fastai for providing highly accessible YouTube videos that helped me create this notebook.
